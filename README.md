# Assembly-Line
Program that solves the assembly line problem with arbitrary number of assembly lines.
This is similar to the 2-assembly line problem.

Here there are N assembly lines in the factory, that exist on the factory floor placed in order.
Each assembly line has M stations.
There is an entry time and exit time defined for each assembly line.
Each station on an assembly line has a processing time.
Transfers are allowed only between adjacent lines from the ith station to  the (i+1)th station.(For example from the 2th station on the 4th assembly line we can only move to the 3rd station on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th assembly line)
